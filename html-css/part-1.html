                <li>Add a title inside the head element, and give the document a name. Ensure  this is a child of the head element.</li>
                <li>Add a body element inside the html element just below the closing head tag.</li>
                <li>Add a meta element to the head indicating that the charset is UTF-8.</li>
                <li>Add any text you like to the body of the document. Any text that you add should be displayed back to you when you open the web page in Chrome.</li>
                <li>Save the document with a .html extension.</li>
                <li>Open the document in Chrome and inspect the Document Object Model in the developer tools.</li>

        <h1>Chapter 2: Basic HTML</h1>
        This lesson explains that the basic elements of a HTML page consists of a head and body tags.
        
        <h2>Step-by-Step instructions for Chapter 2 (Page 16-17)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the template.html page in your text editor.</li>
            <li>Add an h1 element to the page and include some header text.</li>

            <li>Add a quote to the page along with a citation, using the blockquote and cite tags.</li>
            <li>Find an image you would like to include in the page, and add it at the bottom.  Make the image a fixed width, and allow the browser to determine the correct height.</li>
            <li>Add a hyperlink to your page to point to another page in a subfolder of the current page.</li>
            <li>Add a hyperlink to an external website such as Google.</li>
            <li>Although I have not covered it, attempt to turn the image into a hyperlink so that it loads another page when it is clicked.  Hint: The image will need to be a child element of the byperlink.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Chapter 3: Lists and Tables</h1>
        This lesson explains how to structure content into lists and tables, two important concepts in a web page.

        <h2>Step-by-Step instructions for Chapter 3 (Page 24-25)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the template.html page in your text editor.</li>
            <li>Start by creating a simple numbered list of all the tags that you have learned about in this lesson - for instance table, tfoot, and thead.</li>
            <li>Try to convert a numbered list to a description list, capture each element in a dt element and place tag names in dd elements.</li>
            <li>Add a Table to the web page to present the same information, in the same way.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Chapter 4: Introduction to CSS</h1>
        This lesson expands on the "separation of concerns" with HTML responsible for content and CSS responsible for presentation and styling.
        
        <h2>Step-by-Step instructions for Chapter 4 (Page 36-37)</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create contacts.html and contacts.css files.</li>
            <li>Include a link to contacts.css in the head section of the contacts.html file.</li>
            <li>Set Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif as the font family for the entire document.  Include a rule that matches the body element.</li>
            <li>Add a 1-pixel solid black border to the elements table, th and td.</li>
            <li>Add a new style to the above rule with the property border-collapse and value collapse, so the duplicate borders collapse into a single border.</li>
            <li>Add a property called padding with a value of 5px to the td element so there is some space between the content and the border of each cell.</li>
            <li>Set the background for the thead element to color #3056A0 and color to white</li>
            <li>Set the table caption to display in bold, apply only if caption is child of a table element.</li>
            <li>Set tfoot element to be 3/4th the size of font used elsewhere.  Also, set the text alignment to be on the rhs of the table.</li>
            <li>Set every 2nd row of the table body with a background color of #E6E6F5. (use pseudo-class selector tr:nth-child(even) only for the children of tbody, remember to exclude thead</li>
        </ol>
